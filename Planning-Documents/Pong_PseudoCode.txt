Simple collision detection

bool Collision (object_a, object_b)

	bool colX, colY

	// Horizontal collision
	if (object_a.x + object_a.size.x) is bigger than (object_b.x)
	AND if (object_b.x + object_b.size.x) is bigger than (object_a.x)
		colX = true

	// Vertical collision
	if (object_a.y + object_a.size.y) is bigger than (object_b.y)
	AND if (object_b.y + object_b.size.y) is bigger than (object_a.y)
		colY = true
	
	if both colX and colY equal true
		return true

Ball bouncing logic (first draft)

if ball is colliding with ball
	
	ball.velocity.x *= -1
	ball.velocity.y *= dotProduct(paddle.normal, ball.velocity)

The ball is going to get mirrored no matter which way it's going to get hit, so i just need to multiply by -1
'paddle.normal' would be the right-side face of the paddle (with a value of (0, 1))

Menu navigation

enum game_states = 'TITLE_SCREEN', 'MAIN_GAME', 'PAUSE', 'GAME_OVER';
int menu_choice; (Choosing between wanting to replay the game or quit can just be 
		 changed with an int since I think I will change them in dedicated functions)

Mouse control logic

if 'mouseControl' is true

	if mouse is positioned above the game window
		paddle.y = 0
	else if mouse is positioned below the game window
		paddle.y = screenResolution.size.y (the height of the window)
	else
		paddle.y = mouse.y

Mouse position could either be calculated:
	- Based on the player's whole monitor display
	- Or relative to the game window
	- Or based on the centre of the screen (a 'middleOfScreen' variable that gets added/subtracted to the mouse's position maybe)
