Personal notes:
 - Collision detection to use regular AABB
   - Adjusting the angle of the ball could be done by comparing dot product maybe?
   - Angle variable should NOT be an angle or else the sprite's appearance and collision might break
 - Two separate colours for paddles
 - Enums for menu navigation maybe, instead of switches
 - Could make additional modes later if I get the time
	- Player VS AI
	- Player VS Themselves? (Paddle orbits around the centre of the screen, constantly changing the 
	  paddle sprite's rotation in 'update')
