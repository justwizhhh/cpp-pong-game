# C++ Pong Game (ARCHIVE)

A clone of the arcade game 'Pong', with a multiplayer mode, and a singleplayer mode where you play against a CPU paddle of toggleable difficulty.

Made in ~2 months for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Games in C++' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).
